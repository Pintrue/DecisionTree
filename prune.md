## Prune
The main logic of prune is implemented in function prune\_help, which is a helper function for head-recursion depth first search. There are 3 arguments for this function: the current node that is being tested for pruning, the root node that remains same for all recursion, and the validation data as the data for pruning. The first arguments are used for recursion and the second and third arguments are used to test the tree. The main idea is to test all nodes whose 2 children are both leaves, and try to prune it using the results from both sides. This produce 3 cases: unmodified tree, pruned tree using label from left child node, and pruned tree using label from right child node. Then evaluate the tree using the validation data for all 3 cases, compare the their performances, and take the decision with minimum mistakes.
The reason why we use head recursion is that we want to prune the subtree before testing the node, because the node that do not have 2 leaves as children may have 2 leaves after pruning its children.
